# Visual Studio Code Snippets

See them in action here: http://colinthegeek.com/2016/01/21/visual-studio-code-snippets/

## Installation

Run the following commands to clone the snippets from my Github repository:

```bash
cd "Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Code Snippets\Visual C#"
git clone https://github.com/ColinOrr/vstudio-snippets "My Code Snippets"
```

Visual Studio watches and automatically picks up snippets from this folder, so no need for a restart!

## Bonus Boxcar Script

To use the boxcar script:

  1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com)
  2. Double-click on **Boxcar.ahk** in your snippets folder
  3. Create a shortcut to this file into your startup folder
  
Enjoy and have fun :-)
